# iOS-Starter
Starter app for Kinvey iOS 3.x SDK

This is a iOS Sample app to illustrate how to use version 3.x of the [Kinvey](http://www.kinvey.com) iOS library. 

## Concepts illustrated in this sample
* Logging in a user
* Using the 3.x DataStore API to send and retrieve data
* Managing offline data in a "Sync" store and synchronizing it with the backend

## Prerequisites
* iOS 9 or later
* XCode 8.1 or above
* Kinvey iOS library v3.3 (bundled in as a developer preview).
* [Kinvey](https://console.kinvey.com) app ID and secret. Before compiling, replace `appKey` and `appSecret` in the `AppDelegate` with values you obtain from the console.

__Note__: The `master` branch of this starter app uses Swift 3. If you prefer to use Swift 2.3, refer to the Swift 2.3 branch on this repo. Each branch uses the corresponding [Swift-compatible](https://devcenter.kinvey.com/ios/downloads) version of the Kinvey SDK.
